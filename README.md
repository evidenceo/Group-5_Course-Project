ONLINE SHOPPING SYSTEM- STELLAR WEARS

This document aims to create a detailed description of the online shopping system project. Stellar Wears is an online shopping website created to cater to the needs and keep up with the trends of the younger generation. This document covers the requirements, design, use case and test case of the system for implementation.

SCOPE OF THE PROJECT

As mentioned above, this project is set to build an online fashion shopping website - Stellar Wears. It is a website that will cater to the needs of the younger generation in terms of affordability, inclusivity and keeping up with the latest trends. The goal that we want to achieve with this project is an all-in-one online shopping environment for the public to make purchases that meet their needs and wants in the comfort of their homes. The pandemic started with a massive blow on the economy and community, shutting down stores and commercial places. This fueled the need to create this online marketplace. We want to put the safety of the public first, then their desires next. We plan to accomplish this project with the help of our stakeholders, which include but are not limited to the facilitator, the Software developer and inputs from the customer and end-users.
